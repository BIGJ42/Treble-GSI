# Best Treble GSIs Collection for Android Devices

Welcome to my collection of (in my opinion) the **best Treble GSIs (Generic System Images)** for Android devices. This repository serves as a curated list of high-quality, stable, and feature-rich GSIs for users who want to experience the latest Android versions on Treble-compatible devices.

## About Treble GSIs

A **Treble GSI** is a system image that is designed to work across various Android devices that support Project Treble. Project Treble is a major reorganization of Android's architecture, introduced in Android 8.0 (Oreo), which modularizes the system and separates vendor-specific code from the Android OS framework. This allows for easier updates and custom ROM installations.
